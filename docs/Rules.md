# Strategic War - Card Game Rules

## Overview
Strategic War is a two-player card game that combines elements of the classic card game War with strategic placement, memory, and special card effects. The game uses a standard 52-card deck and features suite-based abilities similar to character classes in games like Hearthstone.

## Setup
1. Shuffle the deck and deal 16 cards face-down in a 4x4 grid between the players
2. Each player draws 3 cards to form their starting hand
3. The remaining cards form the draw deck

## Hand Management
- Maximum hand size is 5 cards
- Each turn, a player may perform ONE of the following actions:
  - Swap a card from their hand with a face-down card on the field
  - Discard a card from their hand
  - Draw a card (limited to once per turn)

## Round Structure
1. Both players have 15 seconds to simultaneously select one face-down card on the field to reveal
2. If a player doesn't select a card within 15 seconds, their last card placed on the field from the deck is automatically revealed
3. The revealed cards engage in War (higher value wins)
4. Card effects trigger based on their timing (see Card Effects section)
5. The winner of the War gains points based on the difference in card values

## Card Effects
Cards can have special effects that trigger at different times:
1. When placed on the field from a player's hand
2. When revealed during War
3. After War has been resolved

## Suite Classes
Each suite represents a different class of effects:
- Hearts: Focused on defense, healing, and point generation
- Spades: Aggressive effects and direct damage
- Diamonds: Resource manipulation and card draw effects
- Clubs: Control and disruption effects

## Board Clearing
Certain cards have effects that can:
- Clear multiple spaces at once
- Create chain reactions of card revelations
- Clear spaces based on patterns or conditions
- Remove cards through special suite interactions

## Game End
The game continues until there are no more cards remaining on the field. The player who has won the most rounds is declared the winner.

## Additional Rules
- Card effects can interact with hand management actions
- Some effects can prevent cards from being revealed
- Effects can force reveals or repositioning of cards
- Players can look at cards they've previously seen on the field if revealed by effects

## Advanced Mechanics
- Cards can create chain reactions of reveals and effects
- Some effects modify the base War comparison
- Effects can interact with scoring and point generation
- Board position and adjacent cards can matter for certain effects
